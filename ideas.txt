matter generators:
mg1: gives a matter / sec ( cost: 10 matter and +2 everytime until the 50th ( then x1.02 ) )
a = mg1^1.2 ( 1e5 mg1 = 1e6 matter/sec )
mg2: unlocks after the 60th mg1
cost: 500 matter ( +150 everytime until the 45th ( then x1.04 ) )
generates b mg1 and c matter/sec
b = ( mg2 / 5 ) ^ 0.8
c = mg2^1.22 * 15
mg3: unlocks after 50k matter
cost: 25k matter (x1.3 everytime)
generates d matter/sec
d = mg3^1.4 * 1500
mg4: unlocks after the 3rd mg3
